# Devcontainer config for R & renv
I wrote a simple configuration for working with R. It is based on [microsoft's r-devcontainer](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/r)

# How does this work.

# Installing R packages
I strongly recommend using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to install package.
